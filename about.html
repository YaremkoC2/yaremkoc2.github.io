        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p class="about-box">
            Hey, I'm currently working as a systems administrator for a small-medium company that works in oilfield fabrication.
            During the week I manage IT systems and dive into C# customizations for the Acumatica ERP platform. 
            On weekends, I work a second job teaching coding to kids. I've always believed computer science should be a core 
            subject in schools, so helping the next generation learn and get excited about tech is the coolest
            part of my week. 
        </p>

        <p class="about-box">
            When I'm not coding or trouble shooting something at work, you're likely to find me playing games with my friends,
            watching basketball, or spending time with family. I also like working on hands on projects, especially in the embedded
            systems space. There's something about the merging of software and hardware that makes it extra fun. 
        </p>

        <p class="about-box">
            This site is a place for me to share some of the projects I've worked on, tinker with ideas, 
            and hopefully connect with others who share similar interests.
        </p>
